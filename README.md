# Probability_Casestudy
A probability case study uses real-world data to predict outcomes under uncertainty. It applies statistical and probabilistic techniques to analyze patterns, estimate risks, and make informed decisions.

For example, businesses often evaluate customer behavior data to estimate the likelihood of a purchase, helping them improve marketing strategies, personalize offers, and increase sales.

By transforming uncertain trends into measurable, data-driven insights, probability case studies enable better forecasting, optimized decision-making, and smarter planning across industries such as finance, marketing, healthcare, and operations.
